    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      Holy Unblocker does not log any user traffic or collect user information
      without consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        We use our own analytics service to collect information about your use
        of our website, such as the timestamps of pages accessed and internet
        protocol (IP) addresses. This information is used for analyzing trends,
        administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and
        gathering demographic information. We do not collect any personal data,
        and any information collected is not linked to personally identifiable
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Holy Unblocker is COPPA compliant. We do not willingly collect
        personally identifiable information about anyone who is under 13.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take the protection of your data seriously and implement appropriate
        measures to secure any information we collect. If you would like any
        information to be removed, please{" "}
        <a class={themeStyles.themeLink} href="/contact">contact us</a> to remove

      <h2>Holy Unblocker Premium</h2>
      <p>
        In order to create a Holy Unblocker Premium account, you need to be at
        least 13 years old. By signing up to Holy Unblocker Premium, you agree
        to let us store the following information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>email address</li>
        <li>crytographic hash of your password</li>
        <li>signup IP address</li>
        <li>a record of invoices</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Partners</h2>
      <p>
        By using the Ultraviolet feature of Holy Unblocker, your browser
        automatically creates a secure tunnel to the destination server using
        the Wisp protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        User data that is sent to Holy Unblocker is encrypted in transit using
        HTTPS. However, data that you send over Ultraviolet is not exactly the
        same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultraviolet uses the Wisp protocol to connect to our VPN servers. Think
        of Wisp as a VPN that works in your browser.
      </p>
      <p>Information that may be seen by Wisp is the same as your ISP:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the destination website you're accessing over our VPN does not
          support HTTPS, and instead only supports HTTP, your cookies, headers,
          credentials, and any data you upload <b>won't be encrypted</b>.
        </li>
        <li>The IP address of any website you connect to can be seen.</li>
        <li>
          Websites that do enable HTTPS won't leak any of the above, and are
          fully end to end encrypted, however it is still possible for the site
          your reaching to be identified using the SNI <a
            href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/"
            >Server Name Indication</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please{" "}
        <a class={themeStyles.themeLink} href="/contact">Contact Us</a>.
